# Advanced Database Notes

This repository contains my learning notes for the **Advanced Databases** course.

## How to use this repo

- One **session note per class** → `sessions/`
- One **concept per topic** → `concepts/`
- SQL exercises and solutions → `sql_challenges/`
- External references and learning material → `resources/`
- Diagrams and schemas → `diagrams/`

## Rules
- Write in your own words
- Link sessions → concepts → resources
- Every SQL challenge must include reasoning, not just SQL

## Review process
- Each session or challenge update should be submitted as a Pull Request
- PR titles should be descriptive (e.g. `session-03-indexing`)

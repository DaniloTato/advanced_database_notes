# Session – 2026-02-19

## Topics covered
- Importance of Distributing fields into different tables to avoid redundancy. (approach to the 3NF [Third Normal Form]).
- Use of JOIN to create a filtered cartesian product.

## What I understood
- Database management is closely related to mathematical set theory.
- It is important how we plan and structure our DB to avoid wasting memory because of redundant data.
- JOIN is one of the most important operations to understand when traversing a DB.

## What is still confusing
- Not really familiarized with the concept of FULL JOIN.

## Questions
- How does SQL manage cartessian products internally (JOINS)? I bet it has some optimization trick to relate all fields between tables manually.
- How do we know if our DB supports a FULL JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN? (only LEFT JOIN was supported on _lesson 6_).
- What is the use of a FULL JOIN?
- Is there a way to reliably know if my query is properly optimized?

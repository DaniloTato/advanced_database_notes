# Session – 2026-02-26

## Topics covered
- SQL Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- Using GROUP BY to categorize aggregated results
- Basic introduction to filtering grouped results with HAVING

## What I understood
- Aggregate functions reduce multiple rows into a single value (or one value per group).
- SQL processes queries in a logical order (FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY).
- WHERE filters rows before grouping, while HAVING filters results after aggregation.

## What is still confusing
- The difference between WHERE and HAVING in more complex queries.
- The syntaxis is not bery intuitive to me.

## Questions
- How many different ways are there to look up the same info using different SQL statements? (rhetoric)
